# SPHERE Rundeck Development Operations

This runbook applies only to `rundeck-sphere-dev` and the isolated `/dev` runtime.

## Deployment

Run QA before activation:

```bash
cd /root/rundeck-sphere-dev
git pull --ff-only origin rundeck-sphere-dev
bash -n ops/rundeck/deploy-dev.sh
/opt/sphere/tools/bin/uv pip install --python /opt/sphere-rundeck-dev/venv/bin/python -r backend/requirements.txt
/opt/sphere-rundeck-dev/venv/bin/python -m unittest backend.tests.test_rundeck
npm run qa
bash ops/rundeck/deploy-dev.sh
```

`deploy-dev.sh` stages the backend and frontend release, validates Nginx, activates the
new symlinks, performs API and browser smoke checks, and automatically restores the
previous `/dev` symlinks and Nginx configuration when activation fails. Production
symlinks and the production index hash are verified unchanged on every successful deploy.

From v1.19.0 onward the deploy smoke gate also calls the 1-day Performance Evaluation
endpoint. A SQL/schema/runtime error in evaluation therefore fails activation and restores
the previous DEV release automatically.

The release janitor retains `SPHERE_RELEASES_KEEP` revisions, default `5`, under both:

- `/opt/sphere-rundeck-dev/releases`
- `/var/www/sphere-dev/releases`

## Rundeck credentials

Never place Rundeck tokens in Git, frontend code, browser storage, or application logs.

Reader credential:

- source file: `/etc/sphere/rundeck-readonly.token`
- runtime credential name: `rundeck-reader`
- consumer: `sphere-rundeck-poller.service`
- intended ACL: execution and output read only for the approved SPHERE job scope

Runner credential:

- source file: `/etc/sphere/rundeck-runner.token`
- runtime credential name: `rundeck-runner`
- consumer: `sphere-rundeck-api.service` only when the source file exists
- intended ACL: run and execution read only for the exact approved SPHERE job

The deploy script enforces `root:sphere` ownership and mode `0640`. The Python runtime
prefers systemd's `$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` and keeps the configured token file only as a
rollout fallback.

Keep `RUNDECK_COLLECT_NOW_ENABLED=false` until an authenticated user identity is enforced
in front of the mutating API route.

## Collector watchdog and self-healing

v1.30 adds a dedicated collector watchdog:

- `sphere-rundeck-watchdog.timer` checks the exact configured SPHERE Rundeck job every two minutes.
- Warning threshold defaults to 5 minutes; abort threshold defaults to 10 minutes.
- Auto-abort requires the same execution to breach the threshold on two consecutive checks.
- `SPHERE_WATCHDOG_AUTO_ABORT=false` is the safe default. Enable it only after `RUNDECK_RUN_JOB_ID` is the exact approved collector UUID and the runner credential is present.
- Runtime state is written to `/var/lib/sphere/ingestion/watchdog.json`; no token or Rundeck output body is persisted.
- Prometheus exposition is available at `/dev/api/metrics`; example rules are in `ops/observability/sphere-prometheus-rules.yml`.

The Server Trend chart pins the x-axis to the selected time window and inserts explicit
`NO DATA` regions when collection cadence gaps exceed two expected 10-minute cycles.

## Collection-cycle consistency

`GET /dev/api/history/hosts/latest` returns APP1 through APP5 from one latest READY
Rundeck Collection Cycle. It must never assemble a landscape from independent per-host
latest rows. If the latest manifest and the latest database projection differ, the UI
withholds the operational host table until a complete aligned cycle is available.

## Performance Evaluation

The read-only endpoint is:

```text
/dev/api/evaluation/workloads?period=7d&type=ALL&limit=30
```

Supported periods:

- `1d` — rolling 1-day window versus the preceding 1-day window
- `7d` — rolling 7-day window versus the preceding 7-day window
- `30d` — rolling 30-day window versus the preceding 30-day window

Supported workload filters are `ALL`, `PROGRAM`, and `JOB`. Evaluation is deterministic
and based on normalized Top Consumer observations. It is a performance-review signal,
not a root-cause declaration.

Review inputs include occurrence rate, average/peak Process CPU, average/peak PSS,
Application Server distribution, Critical WP correlation, and average Process CPU change
versus the previous equivalent period. Thresholds are configurable with the
`SPHERE_EVAL_*` variables documented in `rundeck-dev.env.example`.

Quick check:

```bash
curl -fsS 'https://sphere.astraotoparts.co.id/dev/api/evaluation/workloads?period=7d&type=ALL&limit=5'
```

## Platform Health

Operational status is exposed at:

```text
/dev/api/platform/health
```

Signals include:

- Rundeck collector state and credential mode
- filesystem usage
- inode usage
- raw evidence file count and size
- PostgreSQL size, connection count and long transactions
- WAL size when the PostgreSQL role is permitted to inspect it
- retention last success or last failure
- backup status marker
- backend and frontend release counts

The detailed Platform Health table is collapsed by default in the SAP cockpit.

## Retention

Raw evidence, rejected evidence, manifests and PostgreSQL monitoring history follow
`SPHERE_RETENTION_DAYS`, default `90` days. Maintenance is time-gated by
`SPHERE_MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, default `21600` seconds.

Successful maintenance writes:

```text
/var/lib/sphere/ingestion/maintenance.json
```

A retention exception writes only its failure type and timestamp to:

```text
/var/lib/sphere/ingestion/maintenance-error.json
```

No credential or Rundeck response body is written to either status file.

## Backup status contract

A future backup job can publish its latest state to
`SPHERE_BACKUP_STATUS_FILE`, default `/var/lib/sphere/ingestion/backup.json`.

Example:

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "last_success": "2026-09-10T18:00:00+07:00",
  "type": "pg_dump-and-raw-evidence"
}
```

Platform Health reports `NOT_CONFIGURED` until a backup job owns this marker. The health
endpoint does not perform backups itself.

## Visual QA

The default release gate remains dependency-locked and browser-free:

```bash
npm run qa
```

Optional Playwright visual checks are documented in `docs/VISUAL-QA.md`. They cover
1920×1080 and 1366×768 dashboard layouts, the Evaluation section, and resolved SAP issue
severity semantics. Playwright output is ignored by Git so it does not block the clean
working-tree deploy guard.

## First checks during an incident

```bash
systemctl status sphere-rundeck-api.service sphere-rundeck-poller.timer sphere-rundeck-poller.service sphere-rundeck-watchdog.timer sphere-rundeck-watchdog.service --no-pager -l
journalctl -u sphere-rundeck-api.service -u sphere-rundeck-poller.service -u sphere-rundeck-watchdog.service -n 100 --no-pager
curl -fsS https://sphere.astraotoparts.co.id/dev/api/health
curl -fsS https://sphere.astraotoparts.co.id/dev/api/platform/health
curl -fsS 'https://sphere.astraotoparts.co.id/dev/api/evaluation/workloads?period=1d&type=ALL&limit=5'
```

Treat the PostgreSQL projection as query storage and the compressed Rundeck raw log as
RCA evidence. Do not delete the raw archive as a database-repair shortcut.
