"""Deterministic SAP workload evaluation for Basis and Infrastructure teams.

SPHERE evaluates normalized PROGRAM and JOB observations. Results are investigation
signals, not root-cause declarations. v1.20 adds workload-specific historical
baselines, anomaly context and recent performance-shift detection while preserving
backward-compatible assessment fields used by existing clients.
